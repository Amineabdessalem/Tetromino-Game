# Tetromino-Game

## Gameplay


In a typical Tetromino game, the player is presented with a grid where the tetrominoes fall from the top. The player can rotate the tetrominoes to fit them together perfectly, without gaps, to create a solid line. When a solid line is created, it disappears, and any blocks above it fall down.
